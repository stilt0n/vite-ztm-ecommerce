# About

This project is the class project for an online class that I'm going through primarily to learn some new React libraries (Redux/Saga/etc.) that I don't get exposure to at work.

The course project uses a Yarn classic and `create-react-app` setup, but I already know React pretty well, so to make things a little more challenging I'm using Yarn 3 with pnp, nx, and Vite. If the setup is a little bit wonky it's because I've never used any of these tools before.

I'm also using TypeScript, less for the challenge, and more because I enjoy TypeScript.
